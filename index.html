        <h2>About the legend</h2>
        <p>
          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15
          October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and
          statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
          He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics
          and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
          scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research
          and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
          Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
          space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
          came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
          development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
          technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
          technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
          1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]

          After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian
          Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management
          Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary
          fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore;[78] chancellor of
          the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology
          Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna
          University; and an adjunct at many other academic and research
          institutions across India. He taught information technology at the
          International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and
          technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.[79] In
          2011, Kalam was criticised by civil groups over his stand on the
          Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he supported the establishment of the
          nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the local
          people.[80] The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw him
          as a pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the assurances he
          provided regarding the safety features of the plant.[81] In May 2012,
          Kalam launched a programme for the youth of India called the What Can
          I Give Movement, with a central theme of defeating corruption
